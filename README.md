<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Home Page Screenshot][project-image]](https://example.com)

This project is called **Shaker Magique**, the basic principle is simple: a website offering users a list of cocktails manageable by a host.

There are three categories of users:

- The **guest**, who is not connected: he has only a few possibilities, he can join a host (a **host** is a user, who proposes cocktail recipes), in order to see the cocktails that this host proposes, or to consult among the list of all the cocktails independently of the host.
- The **member** has an account: he has the same possibilities as the **guest**, but he can become a **host** and create his own list of cocktails and manage his ingredient stock to propose to other users, only available cocktails.
- The **admin** : he has access to the administration panel. From it, he can consult the list of cocktails where he can manage all the cocktails of the website. Also, he has access to the list of all the ingredients and can manage them.

The usefulness of the site lies in the possibility of proposing its own list of cocktails to its friends during parties for example, according to the ingredients that the organizer of the party (host) has in stock. Because yes, if you propose a cocktail in your menu, but you don't have all the ingredients to make it, then it won't appear, unless you check the ad hoc filter.
